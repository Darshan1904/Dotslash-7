## Project Description

This website is like a playground for your creativity and a personalized shopping experience in one! Imagine designing your own t-shirts, shoes, or chairs, complete with customizable textures, colors, and even AI-generated logos or images. Here's how it works:

1. **Immersive 3D Visualization**: Browse different product categories and interact with realistic 3D models. Rotate, zoom, and examine them from all angles for a complete understanding of their design.

2. **Unleash Your Creativity**: Unleash your inner designer with a range of customization options. Choose from preset colors and textures, upload your own images for a personal touch, or let the AI create a unique logo or image based on your description.

3. **Text-to-Image Magic**: Stuck for inspiration? Don't worry! Describe your idea for a logo or image and our AI will bring it to life, seamlessly integrating it into your design.

4. **Refine Your Masterpiece**: Tweak every detail until you're completely satisfied. Experiment with different combinations of colors, textures, and images to bring your vision to reality.

5. **2D Preview for Peace of Mind**: Before hitting the purchase button, get a clear picture of your final creation with a 2D preview. Visualize how it will look in the real world and make any necessary adjustments.

6. **Discover Hidden Gems**: Our smart product recommendation system takes your customized creation and suggests similar items you might love. Explore new possibilities and expand your shopping horizons.

**More Than Just Shopping**:

This website is more than just a place to buy things; it's an engaging journey of exploration and self-expression. With its innovative features and user-friendly interface, it promises to revolutionize the way you shop online.

## Tech Stack:

The website is built with cutting-edge technologies, including React for the frontend, Three.js for the immersive 3D experience, Python with Flask for the backend, and TensorFlow for recommendation.
